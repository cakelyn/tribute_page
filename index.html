        <h2 id="history">HISTORY</h2>
        <div class="text"><span style="color:red">** SPOILER: HOVER TO VIEW **</span> <span class="spoiler">Aloy was artificially created as a genetic clone of Elisabet Sobeck by GAIA, an AI. Aloy's purpose was to repair GAIA after it sacraficed itself while trying to stop Hades, a rogue AI, from destroying all life on Earth.</span><br>
        <br>
        Aloy was discovered outside of All Mother’s mountain by Matriarch Teersa of the Nora tribe. Because she technically had no mother to speak of, many members of the tribe saw her as a curse, and she was made an outcast. Rost, another outcast, was granted guardianship of Aloy.<br>
        <br>

        <div id="img-div">

          <div id="img-caption" style="font-size:14px">Aloy and Rost</div></center>
        </div>

        <br>
        As a child, Aloy was shunned frequently by the other Nora children. During one of these events, she ran away in a fit of rage and fell down a hole. She ended up in a large, mysterious cave. While exploring the cave in search of an exit, she found a small triangular-shaped device. When she wore this ‘Focus’ it showed her strange images and played stories told by many different people. Once she found a way out of the cave, she met up again with Rost who questioned this new device and demanded she give it to him. Stubbornly she refuse, so Rost let her keep her new ‘toy’.<br>
        <br>
        The Focus proved useful while hunting, and Aloy even used it to aid in saving a Nora boy that was surrounded by a pack of Watchers, though she received no gratitude from the boys father. A routine mocking of outcast-Aloy by the other Nora children became a pivotal moment in her life, where she decided to win the next Proving ceremony and learn the truth of her mother and ultimately her origin.<br>
        <br>
        Aloy spent the next 12 years preparing for the Proving by honing her survival skills with the coaching of Rost. On the day before the Proving, Aloy entered Mother’s Heart for the first time in her life. Outcasts aren’t allowed in the tribe’s city centers and are kept to the outskirts of Nora territory. She met and befriended a foreigner named Erend who introduced her to his traveling companion, Olin, who wore a Focus device that was similar to hers. Olin was very defensive and evasive while being questioned about his device.<br>
        <br>
        The following day was the Proving, and the contestants that completed all obstacles made it to the Altar of the Proving. The proctor declared Aloy as the overall winner and anointed her as a Nora Brave; no longer an outcast. Before the ceremony could be finished, a surprise attack from Cultists erupted. The proctor was killed immediately, and although many of the contestants fought back, all died except for Aloy. After the initial attack, Aloy approached and inspected the Cultist Leader to find that he also was wearing a Focus device. <span style="color:red">** SPOILER: HOVER TO VIEW **</span> <span class="spoiler">Suddenly, a man from the cult named Helis attacked her from behind, strangling her, dangling her over the edge of the mountain, about to slit her throat with his knife. Rost came to her rescue and shot Helis from behind, saving Aloy, but ended up getting stabbed in the stomach. In his flee, Helis ordered the remaining Cultists to burn the place down. Rost died in the explosion and Aloy fell down the mountain.</span><br>
        <br>
        After the attack, Aloy woke up inside All-Mother, where she retrieved her gear and her Focus. While in the mountain, she saw a projection of a woman that looked exactly like her, only much older and with differently styled hair. Teresa explained to Aloy that she believed that the mountain was responsible for giving birth to her. They came across a giant door that scanned Aloy and announced “Halt for identification. Error Alpha Registry Corrupted - Identity cannot be confirmed. Entry denied.” Teersa reacted with joy because the goddess recognized and knew Aloy, but Aloy expressed frustration in not being recognized because of corruption. Perhaps if she could heal the corruption then maybe the door would open? Teersa anointed Aloy as a Seeker to, allowing her to leave the Sacred Lands of the Nora and seek these answers.
